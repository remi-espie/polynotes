# Polynotes 📓

📓 Polynotes is a [Notion](https://www.notion.so)-like tool made to help students taking notes and linking them to different data, with an emphasis on project management !

🥇 This is the 1st iteration of this project, made by a single person ([myself](https://github.com/remi-espie/)), but it will soon expand !

⚖️ Under MIT license, which mean you can reuse, fork and even commercialize this dashboard as long as you keep the same license !

### 👩‍💻 Technical stuff for geeks and nerds : 👨‍💻

[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)+[Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/) backend with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) database !

Email validation through any SMTP service !

[ReactJS 18](https://fr.reactjs.org/)+[ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) frontend, with [MaterialUI](https://mui.com/) for CSS !

[Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) middleware to redirect request to the related service !

All in a (future) single docker container for ease of use ! Just launch `docker compose up` on any machine and it *should* work !

REST compliant, scalable and responsive design !

Should be secure *enough*
